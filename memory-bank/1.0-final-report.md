## Architecture Patterns Validated

### Three-Interface Pattern ✅
Every connector now provides:
1. Direct Python API
2. AI Framework Tools (auto-detect)
3. MCP Server (where applicable)

### Tool Module Pattern ✅
Every `tools.py` module includes:
- `TOOL_DEFINITIONS`: Metadata list
- Core functions: Framework-agnostic operations
- `get_langchain_tools()`: LangChain wrappers
- `get_crewai_tools()`: CrewAI wrappers
- `get_strands_tools()`: Strands wrappers
- `get_tools(framework="auto")`: Auto-detection

### Testing Pattern ✅
Every test module includes:
- `TestToolDefinitions`: Validate metadata
- `Test{Operation}`: Test each tool
- `TestFrameworkGetters`: Test wrappers
- All use `@patch` to mock connectors
